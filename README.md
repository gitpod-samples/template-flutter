Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

Copy and commit the [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) and [`.gitpod.Dockerfile`](./.gitpod.Dockerfile) to your existing project to have the same configuration of this template. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.
